Alex Honeymanâ€™s portfolio of code from three different projects. All data and code for published works are accessible and reproducible.

The three projects:

1) fire_biogeochemistry:
Predicting post-fire soil biogeochemistry. 
Published as: Honeyman, et al. 2022. Statistical learning and uncommon soil microbiota explain biogeochemical responses after wildfire. 
Applied and Environmental Microbiology 88. https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00343-22 

2) snow_hindcasts:
Characterizing fresh snowfall biogeochemical composition as a function of hindcasts of air mass movement. 
Published as: Honeyman, et al. 2018. Regional fresh snowfall microbiology and chemistry are driven by geography in storm-tracked events, Colorado, USA. 
PeerJ 6:e5961. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5961

3) spatial_burn_experiment:
Spatial quantification of microbial activity post-burn in a laboratory experiment. 
Published as: Honeyman, et al. 2023. Optode-based chemical imaging of laboratory burned soil reveals millimeter-scale heterogeneous biogeochemical responses. 
Environmental Research 224. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512300261X
